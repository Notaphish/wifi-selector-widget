This widget/activity is meant to make swapping between different wifi AP's take less effort. It saves a few clicks for me and I hope it will for you too!

There will be a widget soon but for now its just an activity that lets you add things to favourites and click on them to connect to the AP.

The widget will just show the favourites.
